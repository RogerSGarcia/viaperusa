      	<p>
      	Via Perusa has already felt the economic effects of COVID-19 and we continue to try to figure out how to stay afloat during the stay-at-home order. There is a strong possibility we may have to make the very difficult decision to dissolve the company.

      	<p>
      	To everyone who has used our services and products, to whose loyal customers, to friends and family that has helped us in any way, especially during these hard times.
      	Thank you.
      	</p>

      	<p>
      	We will continue to keep you posted for ongoing orders to ensure all transactions and accounts are settled.
